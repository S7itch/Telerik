                        boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia.
                        After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types
                        of tea; some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and
                        astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty,
                        floral or grassy notes.
